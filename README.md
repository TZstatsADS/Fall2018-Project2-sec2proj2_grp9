![screenshot](doc/screenshot2.png)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a version 2.0 of an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on a topic of your choice using [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) or U.S. government open data released on the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) website. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science

## Data Source
Source: [NYC Open Data.](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml)
+ **Description**: The yellow taxi trip records were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP).

+ **Usage**: Original dataset was downloaded on 28/09/2018, which basically contains records from 01-01-2016 to 12-31-2016. Because of the loading speed concern, this app uses only some sample random records from the original dataset.
