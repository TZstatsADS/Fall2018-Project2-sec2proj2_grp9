+ **Project Summary**: 

+ **Data Source**:
	- http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml

+ **Data Description**: The yellow taxi trip records were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP).

+ **Data Usage**: Original dataset was downloaded on 28/09/2018, which basically contains records from 01-01-2016 to 12-31-2016. Because of the loading speed concern, this app uses only some sample random records from the original dataset.
